    <h1><u>
    There are three things we think about when deciding if a recipe is good enough to go on Simply Recipes:-</u></h1>
    <p>
    First, does it work? Recipes need to be easy to follow and provide reliable results, every time.
    
    Second, is it delicious? Does the dish make us smile inside and out? Do we want to eat the whole batch by ourselves? 
    
    Third, is it worth the effort? Do we want to make it again (and again and again)?
    
    To make sure each of these standards is met, we start by working with expert recipe developers  — people with the experience and knowledge to not only develop a good recipe in their own kitchens, but to make sure that recipe works in yours. Next, we thoroughly review and edit every recipe in-house line by line. Finally, each new recipe is run by our team of recipe testers working in home kitchens with the same pots, pans, and tools that you use in yours. Only after all this is the recipe shared on Simply Recipes.
    
    Have feedback for us? We’d love to hear from you! Please contact the team at ranitpal@gmail.com

    <h1><u>
    Diversity & Inclusion:-</u>
    </h1>
    <p>
    Everyone is welcome at the Simply Recipes table: people of all races, religions, genders, sexual orientations, ages, backgrounds, and abilities. We strive to be a resource for every home cook, and we consciously work to make this inclusion felt in every part of the site, from the individuals we hire to the recipes we share.
    
    We’re not perfect, but we hope to get more right than we get wrong. For a full look at our 2022 Diversity & Inclusion commitments and a recap of our commitments and progress from previous years, please see HERE.
